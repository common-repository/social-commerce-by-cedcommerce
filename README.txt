Social Commerce by CedCommerce connects the woocommerce store with the **Facebook** and **Instagram** marketplace by synchronizing the inventory, price, and other product details for the product creation.

== Description ==

Here is the official Social Commerce by CedCommerce plugin that caters to all your needs while you connect your WooCommerce storefront to Facebook & sell across Facebook Commerce surfaces. Now you can bring your WooCommerce products on Facebook Page Shop, **Facebook Shops**, **Facebook Marketplace**, and **Instagram Shopping**. The plugin also enables you to leverage checkout on Facebook and Instagram, scale your brand’s reach, and manage all your orders from a dedicated dashboard.

“More than 1 in 3 people on Facebook in the US use **Facebook Marketplace** each month as a convenient destination to discover, buy, and sell items.” By listing on Marketplace, you can reach buyers where they already are. Moreover, you can also connect your catalog to Instagram Shopping, which enables you to tag products in posts and stories & allow shoppers to buy either on the website or with checkout on **Instagram**.

Social Commerce by CedCommerce helps you to quickly integrate your WooCommerce store with Facebook and helps you in seamless onboarding to Marketplace and Instagram Shopping as well. The extension helps you to leverage significant commerce features of Facebook which includes:

 * **Checkout on Facebook and Instagram** (currently for US merchants)
 * **Shops on Profile** (for global merchants on Page Shops and Shops)
 * **Marketplace and Shops** ( Product Tagging in Posts & Stories and Live Shopping feature)

Facebook Marketplace helps you reach the customers where they are already shopping. You can take advantage of this opportunity to increase your business across Facebook networks and drive more sales.
